Hi everyone, Ali khan here.

Being fascinated by cars, planes, and coffee would be an understatement for me.
I'm absolutely captivated by the engineering marvels of aviation, the sleek designs and powerful engines of automobiles, and the rich flavors and aromas of specialty coffee.
I'm ready to take my passions for these subjects and implement them into the next big thing in tech by creating innovative coding projects and contributing to open-source initiatives that bridge the gap between my interests and the digital world.
